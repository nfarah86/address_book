What I learned from making this app:

1) CSS and inline-block

	a) 

	<form id = main-parent-form>

	<div class = "items">
		<label> Email </label>
		<input type = 'text' name = 'email'/> 
		
	</div>
	</form>

	vs. 

	b)

	<form id = main-parent-form>
	<div class = "item-text">
		<label> Email </label>
			<div class = 'field'><input type = 'text' name = 'email'/> 
			</div>
	</div>
	</form>

	*** this difference between a and b is the divs... first one- a) wraps everything in one div... the second example: b) has two divs: one for the label and one for the field..

	problem: how to get ie:  Email : <<text field>> aligned in one line.  Initally, I attacked this with targeting ie .item-text or .field...with display: inline-block or created separate css fields that attacked one or the other...

	how the problem was solved:


	#main-parent-form label, #main-parent-form .field{
	display: inline-block;
	background-color: gray;
}
	==>here i reference EACH DIV that I want to be inline-block..

	this is different from a) example because, it has one div, so you can just do .items{ display: inline-block} and that would solve that problem.
